					Dear Friends
					<br><br>
					Asad H. Sahir, PhD is currently responsible for professional development at IIT Ropar. A chemical engineering academician in his current avatar, he is utilizing the training acquired as a Higher Education Teaching Specialist and a Teaching Assistant Scholar at the University of Utah to help students achieve their professional aspirations with the support of Career Development and Corporate Relations Centre team members at IIT Ropar.
					<br><br>On the field of professional development, he was an active member of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s Postdoctoral Committee which organized numerous training events ranging from talks from distinguished scientists to US Department of Energy administrators. On similar lines, he is working to develop a vibrant community of students who will be the next generation science and technology leaders, and sharing his privileged experiences.<<br><br>When Dr. Sahir is not involved with academic, research and administrative matters, he always welcomes the opportunity to learn from students on creating an academic environment which fuels inspiration, achievement and creates opportunities for transformative learning. A favorite pastime of his nowadays is to draw cartoons for his daughter and rediscover corporate, administrative and academic life from his IIT Ropar and CDCRC team members over a cup of coffee and a nice hot brownie.<br><br>He feels inspired by reading Creativity, Inc.: Overcoming the Unseen Forces That Stand in the Way of True Inspiration (Ed Catmull), Extreme Ownership: How U.S. Navy SEALs Lead and Win (Jocko Willink) , Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead (Sheryl Sandberg) and The Art of Possibility: Transforming Professional and Personal Life (Benjamin Zander). Though not a musician, his interests range from Bach to Rachel Platten; and has recently discovered Desert Island Discs BBC podcasts which is furthering his knowledge.

					धियो यो नः प्रचोदयात् <br><br>
					(Deploy our intellect on the right path).

					Jai Hind!
