                                    IIT Ropar keeps continually re-inventing itself in terms of the academic
                                    curriculum so that it can stay ahead of its times and provide its students with
                                    the best set of skills to excel. Our students today have the flexibility to take
                                    cross-departmental courses as additional or even complete a minor degree in
                                    another department, in addition to learning the ins and outs of their major
                                    degree. We also provide them with the opportunity to complete a
                                    Micro-specialization in extremely important aspects of engineering like systems
                                    reliability, embedded wireless systems or even biomedical devices. This enables
                                    them to undertake interdisciplinary research and be more holistic in their
                                    approach towards the industry.</p>
