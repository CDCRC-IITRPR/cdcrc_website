					Dear Friends<br><br>
                    It gives me immense pleasure to invite you all to Indian
                    Institute of Technology Ropar campus
                    for 2021-22 placement and internship sessions. 
                    The IIT brand name is world-renowned and needs
                    no introduction. In accordance with the high 
                    expectations from IITians, our students and 
                    graduates have earned numerous accolades
                    from the organisations that they worked 
                    with as interns or as employees and I am certain that
                    your recruitment team will have a very 
                    productive and satisfying visit to our institute.
                    <br><br>
                    The curriculum at IIT Ropar is designed to 
                    not only provide students with extremely strong technical
                    knowledge but to also hone their personal 
                    development so that they become well rounded individuals
                    who are an asset to any organisation that 
                    they are part of. Our students receive
                    opportunities to learn not just through well 
                    designed classroom and laboratory activities but
                    also through active participation in research 
                    and industrial collaboration projects, student societies
                    and competitions, social service activities, 
                    and through exposure to enterpreneurship from an early stage.
                    <br><br>
                    Apart from our exceptional students, our rather
                    great strength lies in our faculty, who have performed years of cutting edge 
                    research in highly reputed organisations 
                    around the world. With the active mentoring 
                    from the faculty members, our students are exposed to the 
                    latest technological developments in their field, 
                    enabling them to achieve their full potential.
                    Once again I cordially invite you to our campus 
                    for placements and I look forward to continuing a fruitful relationship
                    between your organisation and IIT Ropar.
                    <br><br>
					धियो यो नः प्रचोदयात् <br><br>
					(Deploy our intellect on the right path).
					<br><br>

					Jai Hind!
